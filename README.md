# -Task-15-End-to-End-Machine-Learning-Pipeline

This project implements a Machine Learning pipeline to classify breast cancer tumors as malignant or benign using the Breast Cancer dataset from Scikit-learn. The workflow includes data loading, preprocessing using StandardScaler with ColumnTransformer, and model training using Logistic Regression within a Pipeline.

The dataset is split into training and testing sets, and the model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The complete trained pipeline, including preprocessing and model, is saved as a .pkl file for future use.
